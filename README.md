# scratchRemulate
Remulate is a tool that finds all links for a Scratch user. Type in the username, and this website will give you all links for that user. Type in a username to get their Scratch account, their Ocular account, their ScratchStats page, and their Postpercent page. Have fun! 

Yes i know this is sorta derpy because you could just search these by yourself. I KNOW.
